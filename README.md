A doubly linked which implements an interface called “MyList” which defines several methods that
a list data structure should include. Please carefully read the comments in the MyList interface
before you start coding. It makes use of a head node and a tail node to make appending to the end of 
the list easier and faster. This is a type of linked list that has a next pointer and a prev pointer 
and assumes nothing about the item being stored, it uses the base Object class. A nested private Node 
class is defined within the Doubly linked list.
